###Variables
Have many Kind of variable in Java:

1. Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields): these variable  known as instance variables, declared variable without static keyword, these variables are unique for each instance of the class (each object)

2. Class Variables (Static Fields): A class variable is any field declared with use static modifier

3. Local Variables: this variable declared within the body of a method. Then you can use the variable only within that method. Other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.

4. Parameters: a variable that is passed to a method when the method is called such as :

`public static void sum (int num1 , int num2 ) // num1 , num2 args is considered a parameter`




Naming variable in Java:

- Variables are case-sensitive.
- Variables name can have Letters,digits and two special characters ( _ and $ ).
- Names start with a letter,underscore or $ sign but can not start with a number.
- White space is not allowed.
- Can not be a reserved keyword like ( int,String ).

###Expressions, Statements, and Blocks

Expressions :An expression is a series of variables, operators, and method call that evaluates to a single value.
  <br> <br> EX: <br> <br>
       `
            if (number1 == number2) // here is Expressions
            System.out.println("Number 1 is larger than number 2");`


Statements : In Java, each statement is a complete unit of execution.
<br> <br> EX: <br> <br>
                `int score = 9*5;`


Blocks: A block is a group of statements (zero or more) that is enclosed in curly braces { }.
<br> <br> EX: <br> <br>


        class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        
                if (10 > 5) { // start of block	
         
                } // end of block
            }
        }

###Control Flow Statements

in Java compiler executes the code from top to bottom. The statements in the code are executed according to the order in which they appear.
Java provides three types of control flow statements.<br> <br>

Decision Making statements

1.if statements
  - switch statement
  - Loop statements
  - do while loop 

2.while loop
  - for loop
  - for-each loop

3.Jump statements
  - break statement
  - continue statement
